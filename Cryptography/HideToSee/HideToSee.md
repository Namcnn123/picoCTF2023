How about some hide and seek heh?
Look at this image [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/240/atbash.jpg).


## **Hints**
Download the image and try to extract it.

## **Approach**
Just put the file into [this stegno tool](https://futureboy.us/stegano/decinput.html).

and it will magically give you the flag in atbash decode it with decode.fr and get the flag.

This challenge was guess the website we did to extract the flag and this was branded as a cryptography challenge. LOL!
