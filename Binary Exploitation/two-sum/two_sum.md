## **Hints**
None.

## **Approach**
The program asks us to provide 2 integers that would satisfy the equation:

>n1 > n1 + n2 OR n2 > n1 + n2

we will not exit the program (unlike the first one) and in order to finally get the flag we need to ensure that num1 > 0 || num2 > 0.

We can overflow the sum with 2 positive integers to satisfy all the conditions, so entering: 2147483647; 2147483647 we can get the flag:
