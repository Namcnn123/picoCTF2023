## **Approach**

I used Burp Suite to solve this. Open burp suite and turn on the intercept and login the page on the browser.

Then forward repeatedly to get all the packet.
In the login session, i found this string in line id = .
> cGljb0NURntwcm94aWVzX2Fs

And i decoded it by base64.

>picoCTF{proxies_al

Continue the search for the rest of the flag, and i found this string in the header id = .

> bF90aGVfd2F5X2EwZmUwNzRmfQ==

Decodeed it and found:
 >l_the_way_a0fe074f}
