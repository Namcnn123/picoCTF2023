## **Description**

There's an interesting script in the user's home directory
Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

## **Hints**
None.

## **Approach**

That was a tricky challenge, in the home directory there is a file named useless that does command line arithmetic, spoiler, it does nothing.

The interesting thing to notice was the code itself, specifically the line:
```
else
    echo "Read the manual"
```
Using man on the script we get the flag hidden at the bottom of the page.
