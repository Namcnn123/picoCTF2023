## **Description**
---
Reception of Special has been cool to say the least. That's why we made an exclusive version of Special, called Secure Comprehensive Interface for Affecting Linux Empirically Rad, or just 'Specialer'. With Specialer, we really tried to remove the distractions from using a shell. Yes, we took out spell checker because of everybody's complaining. But we think you will be excited about our new, reduced feature set for keeping you focused on what needs it the most. Please start an instance to test your very own copy of Specialer.
## **Hints**
Experiment with different shell syntax.

## **Approach**

This challenge is much more easier than the first one. We only need to use 
>"cd" and "echo"

Follow these steps to get the flag
```
echo *
cd ala
echo *
echo "$(<kazam.txt )"
return 0 picoCTF{y0u_d0n7_4ppr3c1473_wh47_w3r3_d01ng_h3r3_a8567b6f}
```
